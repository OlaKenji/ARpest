Windows installation test
=========================

1) Open "Anaconda Prompt" (try as normal user first, but potentially this has 
to be opened as Admin)

2) In order not to mess up your dependencies (*), create a virtual 
environment with python version 3.7.5
```
$ conda create --name testenv python==3.7.5
[some output]
$ conda activate testenv
(testenv) $
```

3) Inside your virtual environment, run the following command to download and 
install ds-arpes-pkugin with all its dependencies. This means that arpys 
and data_slicer will also be installed:
```
(testenv) $ pip install ds-arpes-plugin
```
This will create a lot of console output. If everything succeeded, you should 
see something like `Successfully installed ds-arpes-plugin` towards the end.

If this fails, it would be nice if you could check if `pip install 
data_slicer` and `s` work.

4) If we got this far, that's already amazing! :) To top it off, we could 
test the installation. First, we open PIT:
```
(testenv) $ python -m data_slicer.pit
```
This should bring up a window with some example data and an ipython console 
in the bottom right.
Then we want to check if we can load plugins. In PIT's ipython console, type:
```
arpes = mw.load_plugin('ds_arpes_plugin')
```

5) If this succeeds we can try to load some ARPES data:
```
arpes.load_data('\your\path\to\arpes\data')
```

6) As a bonus, we could even test the angle to k space conversion!
Roll the axes if necessary (pit.roll_axes()) until we are looking at the data 
from a convenient viewpoint.
Then try to use the `arpes.a2k()` function to make the conversion.
Type `help(arpes.a2k)` to learn more about how this should be done.

7) Finally, close PIT and leave the virtual environment by issuing `conda 
deactivate` in your Anaconda prompt or just close the Anaconda prompt window.

8) Thank you very much!

Footnotes
---------

(*) You most likely have many different python packages installed on your 
systems, like matplotlib, numpy, scipy, etc. These all have a specific 
version. Certain packages, however, depend on specific versions of other 
packages and may not work if you have the wrong version installed. Obviously, 
with many packages, this bears the potential of becoming very messy and 
complicated. That's the main reason virtual environments have been created. 
The idea is, to create an isolated environment of you python install, 
completely separate from your system installation or other virtual 
environments. The new environment comes without any additional packages 
(usually). So if you were to list your installed packages of your system 
install with the command `pip freeze` like this:
```
$ pip freeze
matplotlib==2.2.4
numpy==1.13.1
[...]
```
it would look like this, once you are "in" a newly created environment:
```
(env) $ pip freeze
[nothing]
```
.
Everything you install into this virtual environment only lives there, 
keeping your system installation "clean".  It is also possible to have 
varying python versions and more things, but that's the gist of it.
